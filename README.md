# Neighborhood Map

## About

This project is part of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree. This project requires us to build a single page application with KnockoutJS, the Google Maps API and one other API of our choice. I chose to build a map that shows a few spots in downtown Helena that I like to eat at. When you click on either the restaurant name or the map marker, you will see a window appear with the restaurant's contact information, which is obtained through the Foursquare API. You also have the option of using an input field to filter by restaurant name.

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repository and open the ```index.html``` file in your browser.

## Notes

I am part of one of the last group of students to go through the old version of the Front End Nanodegree that bases this project on KnockoutJS instead of React. After I finish my Nanodegree, I plan to redo this project in React since that is what we use at work. Normally I like to try and add a feature or two to my projects so I can get more practice in. However, this time I am aiming to only meet the bare minimum requirements so that I can focus my time and energy on the framework that will benefit me more in my day-to-day work.
